STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION
### Objective:
### The goal of this task is to analyze historical stock market data and predict future stock prices using time series forecasting techniques. This involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling the stock price trends, and forecasting using advanced machine learning models like ARIMA and LSTM. 
### Data Preparation:
### Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize data, etc.).
### Split the data into training and testing sets.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
### Visualize historical trends, distributions, and correlations using tools like matplotlib and seaborn.
### ARIMA Model:
### Use the ARIMA model for time series analysis and forecasting.
### Plot the forecasted values against actual data to evaluate performance.
### LSTM Model:
### Prepare data sequences (e.g., look_back window) for LSTM input.
### Train an LSTM neural network on historical stock prices.
### Predict future prices and compare predictions with actual values.
### Evaluation:
### Compare the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models to assess which provides better accuracy for stock price prediction.
